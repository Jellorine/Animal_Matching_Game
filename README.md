# Animal Matching Game

Welcome to the Animal Matching Game! In this fun and interactive game, your goal is to match the displayed animal name with the correct animal image from the grid. Each time you select the right animal, you win! If not, the game will show a "LOSE" message, and you'll have the chance to try again with a new animal.
